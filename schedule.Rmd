"Chapters 1-3: Overview, Review of Simple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, MSE, Bias/Variance Trade-off, Train/Test Errors

#### Wed, Sept 5

 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * Material from: Chapter 1, Section 2.1, Section 2.2.1, and Section 3.1 of ISLR
    * Overiew of the Class: slides [pdf](materials/20180904_intro/20180904_slides_class_overview.pdf)
    * Notation
    * Mini-demo and reminder about Simple Linear Regression, estimation via ordinary least squares
        * Warmup: [pdf](materials/20180904_intro/20180904_slr_warmup.pdf)
        * Summary of R commands and interpretation for SLR: [pdf](materials/20180904_intro/201800904_SLR_summary.pdf)
        * Code for later:  
`beer <- read.csv(\"http://www.evanlray.com/data/openintro/bac.csv\")`  
`beer`  
`source(\"http://www.evanlray.com/stat340_f2018/materials/20180904_intro/plot_ss.R\")`  
`plot_ss(beer$Beers, beer$BAC)`  
    * Set up GitHub accounts and RStudio
        * Video overview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxZ8J2rqhEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxZ8J2rqhEM)
        * Pdf with detailed instructions: [pdf](resources/Stat340-github-setup.pdf)
 * **After class**, please:
    * Finish the activity from class about setting up your GitHub account on RStudio, if you didn't finish this in class.  **This must be done before class on Friday!**  If you run into trouble, come by my office and we will sort it out!
    * **Fill Out** this survey about when my office hours should be held: [http://whenisgood.net/y7js2rh](http://whenisgood.net/y7js2rh)
    * **Register** for Piazza at [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/fall2018/stat340](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/fall2018/stat340)
    * **Read**:
        * Chapter 1 of ISLR
        * Sections 2.1, 2.2.1, and 2.2.2 of ISLR (Section 2.2.3 will be discussed in a few weeks)
        * Section 3.1 of ISLR
        * The part of 3.3.2 titled \"Non-linear Relationships\" of ISLR
        * Handout about Simple Linear Regression
    * **Post Questions** about Simple Linear Regression on Piazza if you have them (anonymously if you want!).  It's ok to not remember stuff or understand it fully from the reading!  It's not ok to be confused in silence.
    * **Homework 1**: Complete 4 [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) chapters from the Introduction to R course: Intro to basics, Vectors, Factors, and Data frames.  You will get an email by the end of the day on Sept 5 inviting you to join our class organization with assignments pointing you to the specific chapters to do.  You should **feel free to work on this in groups** -- but please **each complete your own copy of this assignment**!  Your grade on this assignment is only for completion, not correctness.  If you get stuck, post a message on Piazza!  I don't expect you to remember everything or feel like an expert at it; we will continue working on this over the rest of the semester.  This is just a first introduction.  If you have done these chapters for a previous class, you don't need to do them again.
